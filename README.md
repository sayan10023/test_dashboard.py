The assignment includes:
- 🧪 **Manual Functional Testing** of the Segwise.ai dashboard to identify usability bugs or inconsistencies.
- 🔁 **Regression Checklist Creation** to validate stable functionality after product updates, covering Filters, Boards, and Custom Reports.
- 🤖 **Automation Task** using Selenium to simulate login, navigate the dashboard, and verify the presence of key UI elements like charts or metrics.
